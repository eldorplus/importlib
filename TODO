=== 0.1.0 ===
* Address any IP concerns.
* Add importlib2-specific tests.
* Document which APIs require calling inject() first (add a check to those APIs?).
* Ensure docstrings and docs are sufficient.

=== 0.9.0 ===
* Solve "utf-32-be" codec looup problem under 3.2.
* Don't expose the fixers for _os and _imp.
* Pull more changes out of importlib2 and into fixers (to reduce the diff from upstream).

* Move to-do items into bitbucket tracker.

=== Others ===
* Forward-port some fixes into importlib?

* Improve performance where it matters (it probably doesn't).
