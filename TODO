=== Phase 1 ===
* Add importlib2-specific tests.
* Auto-call hooks.inject() when importing importlib2?
* Solve "utf-32-be" codec looup problem under 3.2.
* Fix 3 tests in tests/test_importlib/source/test_file_loader.py.
* Don't expose the fixers for _os and _imp.
* Remove bootstrapping-related code?
* Remove deprecated APIs?
* Document which APIs require calling inject() first (add a check to those APIs?).
* Ensure docstrings and docs are sufficient.
* Set up continuous integration (perhaps https://www.shiningpanda-ci.com/ or https://travis-ci.org/).
* Address any IP concerns.
* Release 0.1.0.

=== Phase 2 ===
* Forward-port some fixes up into importlib?
* Automate backporting (a la https://bitbucket.org/ericsnowcurrently/backport_importlib)?
* Improve performance where it matters.
* Pull in others?
