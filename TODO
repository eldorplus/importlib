=== Phase 1 ===
* Pull in cpython:Lib/test/test_importlib.
* Pull in others?
* Remove bootstrapping-related code.
* Update to work under 2.7 and 3.2.
* Set up continuous integration (perhaps https://www.shiningpanda-ci.com/).
* Release 0.1.0.

=== Phase 2 ===
* Automate backporting (a la https://bitbucket.org/ericsnowcurrently/backport_importlib)?
